Primitives to discuss:

1. Integer types
2. Floating-point types
3. Characters
4. Booleans
5. Literals
6. Variables
	- Dynamic Initialization
	- Scope
	- Lifetime
7. Type Conversion and Casting
	- Conversion - Two types are compatible, and the destination type is larger than the source
			:- no automatic conversion from numeric types to char or boolean
			:- char and bool are not compatible
	- Cast - explicit conversion between incompatible types
	- Type Promotion (apply to expressions)
			:- byte, short, and char values are promoted to int
			:- if one operand is long, the whole expression is promoted to long
			:- if one is float, entire expression is promoted to float
